# Section 2 - Securing Web MVC 

This repository is an implementation of Practical Spring Security Course. I used the same approach explained in the Spring Security in Action (Hands-on: A small secured web application).  

However, I modified the code for the purpose of the course. Please see the code base of Section 6 in Spring Security in Action for more details: https://github.com/havinhphu188/spring-security-in-action-source/tree/98a34b30c44c48ddc3ce66bb0f3f932543ff29a7/ssia-ch6-ex1
